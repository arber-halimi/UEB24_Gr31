      <h3>History of the Louvre Museum</h3>
      <hr>
        <p>
            The Louvre Museum is located in the heart of Paris, France, on the Right Bank of the Seine River. 
            It is situated within the 1st arrondissement, one of the city's central districts, known for its rich history and cultural landmarks. 
            The museum's main entrance is through the Louvre Pyramid, which stands in the Cour Napoléon courtyard.

        <p>The Louvre's transformation into an art museum began during the French Revolution. In 1793, 
          the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces. 
          The museum opened its doors to the public on August 10, 1793, featuring an initial collection of 537 paintings, 
          most of which were royal and confiscated church property.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the Louvre underwent numerous expansions and renovations. 
          Napoleon Bonaparte significantly increased the museum's collection with art seized during his military campaigns, 
          and the museum was temporarily renamed the Musée Napoléon. Subsequent French rulers, including Louis XVIII and Charles X, 
          continued to enrich the museum's holdings.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>The most significant modern addition to the Louvre is the glass pyramid entrance, designed by architect I. M. Pei,
           which was inaugurated in 1989. This contemporary structure stands in stark contrast to the classical architecture of the palace,
            symbolizing the museum's blend of tradition and innovation.</p>
